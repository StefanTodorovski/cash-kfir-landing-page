# Google Analytics Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Google Analytics with tracking ID `G-8DY1F31TH3` into your React landing page app. This is the same tracking ID used by your existing Angular app, allowing for unified analytics across both applications.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Analytics Service (`src/shared/services/analytics.ts`)
- **New File**: Comprehensive analytics service similar to your Angular implementation
- **Features**:
  - Google Tag initialization with proper script injection
  - Custom event tracking with app identification
  - Page view tracking
  - Specialized tracking methods for different user interactions
  - Development mode logging for testing

### 2. Analytics Hooks (`src/shared/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`)
- **New File**: React hooks for easy analytics integration
- **Hooks**:
  - `useAnalytics()`: Main analytics hook with automatic page view tracking
  - `useScrollTracking()`: Automatic scroll depth tracking (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

### 3. Updated Files
- `src/App.tsx`: Added analytics and scroll tracking initialization
- `src/shared/hooks/index.ts`: Exported new analytics hooks
- `src/shared/hooks/useRequestDemo.ts`: Added demo request tracking
- `src/shared/config/environment.ts`: Added Google Analytics ID configuration
- `src/features/landing/components/CTASection.tsx`: Added CTA button tracking
- `src/features/landing/components/HeroSection/HeroContent.tsx`: Added hero button tracking
- `src/shared/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`: Added navigation tracking

## Analytics Events Being Tracked

### 1. Page Views
- Automatic tracking on app load
- Custom app identification: `morningful_landing_page`

### 2. User Interactions
- **CTA Button Clicks**: "Request a Demo", "Join Beta Waitlist", "Contact Sales", "Watch Overview"
- **Navigation Clicks**: Menu items, logo clicks, sign-in button
- **Demo Requests**: Form submissions (success/failure)
- **Scroll Depth**: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% milestones

### 3. Custom Events
- `demo_modal_opened`: When demo modal is opened
- `demo_request_submitted`: Successful form submissions
- `demo_request_failed`: Failed form submissions
- `cta_button_click`: All CTA button interactions
- `navigation_click`: Navigation menu interactions
- `scroll_depth`: Scroll milestone tracking

## Event Structure
All events include:
- `app_name`: "morningful_landing_page" (to distinguish from Angular app)
- `event_category`: Categorizes the type of interaction
- `event_label`: Specific action identifier
- Custom parameters for detailed tracking

## Development vs Production
- **Development**: Events logged to console for debugging
- **Production**: Events sent to Google Analytics (G-8DY1F31TH3)

## Benefits
1. **Unified Analytics**: Both apps feed into the same GA property
2. **Comprehensive Tracking**: All major user interactions are tracked
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Centralized analytics service
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
5. **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimized script injection

## Testing
The implementation includes development logging, so you can test by:
1. Opening browser developer tools
2. Interacting with buttons, navigation, and forms
3. Checking console logs for analytics events

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production to start receiving real analytics data
2. Set up custom dashboards in Google Analytics to separate data between apps
3. Consider adding more granular tracking for specific features as needed

All tracking is now active and will provide valuable insights into user behavior across both your Angular and React applications!
