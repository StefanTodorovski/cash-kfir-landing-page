                <p className="mb-4">
                  Morningful offers a Platform for tracking the customer bank
                  accounts, as further described below and in the Documentation.

                </h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Morningful's Platform acts as a central hub for Financial
                  Data, allowing Customer to collect Financial Data from its
                  selected sources ("<strong>Sources</strong>"), such as banks
                  of applications, and send the Financial Data to Customer's
                  chosen destinations ("<strong>Destinations</strong>"), such as
                  Customer's databases or its accounts with third-party
                  applications or services, for Customer's further use. The
                  supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the
                  Documentation. For Sources owned or controlled by Customers ("
                  <strong>Customer Properties</strong>"), Customer enables the
                  collection of Financial Data by implementing Morningful's
                  JavaScript, or other code ("<strong>Morningful Code</strong>")
                  on such Customer Properties. As further described below and in
                  the Documentation, Customer maintains control over which
                  Sources and Destinations it uses with the Platform, as well as
                  the types and content of Customer Data it shares between its
                  Sources and Destinations.

                  Each party (as "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") agrees that

                  financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("
                  <strong>Disclosing Party</strong>") constitute the

                  is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or
                  should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be
                  confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the
                  information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the
                  disclosure. Any Morningful technology, performance information
                  relating to the Platform, and the terms and conditions of this
                  Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Platform
                  without any marking or further designation. Except as
                  expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party shall (1)
                  hold in confidence and not disclose any confidential
                  information to third parties and (2) not use confidential
                  information for any purpose other than fulfilling its
                  obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.
                  The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to
                  its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives
                  having a legitimate need to know (including, for Morningful,
                  the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.10), provided that
                  such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations
                  no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section
                  10 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for
                  compliance by any such representative with the terms of this
                  Section 10. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations
                  shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can
                  document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it
                  prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or
                  has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving
                  Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party
                  from a third party without breach of any confidentiality
                  obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of
                  the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The
                  Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by
                  law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the
                  Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to
                  obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party
                  acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would
                  cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a
                  sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure
                  by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled
                  to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever
                  other remedies it might have at law.

                  Morningful will process Customer Data only in accordance with
                  Customer's instructions. By entering into the Agreement,
                  Customer instructs Morningful to Process Customer Data to

                    Not more than once per calendar year and at Customer's
                    expense, Customer may audit Morningful's Processing of
                    Customer Personal Data for compliance with its obligations
                    under this Addendum by submitting reasonable requests for
                    information, including security and audit questionnaires.
                    Morningful will provide written responses to the extent the
                    requested information is necessary to confirm Morningful's
                    compliance with this Addendum. However, if the requested
                    information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued
                    within the 12-month period prior to Customer's request and
                    Morningful confirms there have been no material changes in
                    the interim relevant to Customer's request, Customer agrees
                    to accept such Third Party Report in lieu of a written
                    response. Any information provided by Morningful under this
                    Section 2.b. constitutes Morningful's Confidential
                    Information under the Agreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section
                    2.b., Morningful may object to the auditor if the auditor
                    is, in Morningful's reasonable opinion, not independent, a
                    competitor of Morningful or otherwise unqualified. Such an
                    objection by Morningful will require Customer to appoint
                    another auditor or conduct the audit itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Customers will promptly notify Morningful of any
                    non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit and
                    provide Morningful any audit reports generated in connection
                    with any audit under this Section 2.b., unless prohibited by
                    EU Data Protection Law or otherwise instructed by a
                    supervisory authority. Customer may use the audit reports
                    only for the purposes of meeting Customer's regulatory audit
                    requirements and confirming that Morningful's Processing of
                    Customer Personal Data complies with this Addendum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Customer shall reimburse Morningful for any time expended by
                    Morningful or its Subprocessors in connection with any
                    audits under this Section 2.b. at Morningful's then-current
                    professional services rates, which shall be made available
                    to Customer upon request. Customer will be responsible for
                    any fees charged by any auditor appointed by Customer to
                    execute any such audit. Nothing in this Addendum shall be
                    construed to require Morningful to furnish more information
                    about its Third Party Subprocessors in connection with such
                    audits than such Third Party Subprocessors make generally
                    available to their customers. Nothing in this Section 2.b.
                    shall require Morningful to breach any duties of
                    confidentiality.
